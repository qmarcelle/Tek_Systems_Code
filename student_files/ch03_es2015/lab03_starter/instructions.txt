Lab Exercise 3
--------------

Introduction:
    In this exercise, you will use ES2015 features while revisiting the previous
    exercise.  You will also create a new class called ContactSearch.
    Shortly, ContactSearch will allow a user to look up a contact by their contactid.


1. Begin by opening the src/components/contact.jsx file.  Modify the Contact class such
   that the this.props.contacts.map() call uses an arrow function instead of the existing
   standard-style function.

   Test the change by running:
        npm install (from the lab03_starter folder)
        npm run create-bundle
        npm start

        (or run any of these from within WebStorm as previously discussed)


2. Create a new file within the components directory called contactsearch.jsx.
   Create a new class in this file called ContactSearch.  This class will
   encapsulate a form.  Create the class to have a constructor.  Allow it to accept
   one argument called: props.

   Within the constructor (since you are providing it), you should call the base class
   constructor (pass props into it).  Also, within the constructor (after the super() call),
   set a variable called state on the this object as follows:

   this.state = { searchVal: '500' };


3. The render function of ContactSearch should render a form.  It should have the
   following structure:

   <form className="search-form">
       <span>Enter Contact ID: </span>
       <input type="text" placeholder="500"
              value={this.state.searchVal} />
       <input type="submit" value="Find Contact" />
   </form>


4. Make ContactSearch the default export from this module.

5. Edit app.jsx to no longer import the ContactList, but rather, to import the
   ContactSearch form.
   Note: if you wish to comment out the ContactList component, but not delete it,
   the syntax for commenting something out in JSX is:

   {/* <ContactList contacts={this.props.contacts}/> */}
