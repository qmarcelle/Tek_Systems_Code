1. Ensure you have installed global packages (as discussed in previous examples):

   npm install -g babel-cli
   npm install -g webpack
   npm install -g webpack-dev-server


2. Install Local Packages:

   npm install

   Note: From within WebStorm, you may right-click on package.json and choose:

            Show npm scripts

   then right-click again and choose:   npm install


3. Run the ExpressJS Server:

   From a command-line within the project directory, issue the command:

                node server.js

   This should cause server.js to start which launches an ExpressJS server (on port 8006).
   Internally, this will also cause the webpack command to run which then
   examines the webpack.config.js file and compiles it.  It invokes Babel to compile the
   ES2015 resources/modules into a file called bundle.js.  bundle.js is created in memory.

   Note: From within WebStorm, you can simply double-click the server entry in the npm
   scripts view.  This will automatically run the server and compile bundle.js.
