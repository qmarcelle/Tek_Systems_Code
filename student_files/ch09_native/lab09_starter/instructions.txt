Lab Exercise 9 - Building the React Native Movie Application
------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
    In this exercise, you will attempt to build the Movie application using
    React Native.  This exercise is optional as it requires a second device
    such as a mobile device or tablet.



1. Install yarn and the create-react-native-app
   -------------------------------------------------------
   If you are running npm > 5.x (check with npm -v), then you should first install yarn.
   To install yarn, visit the yarn homepage (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/),
   select your operating system, and follow the instructions.


   With yarn installed, next install create-react-native-app by issuing the following
   command from a terminal or command window:


   yarn global add create-react-native-app



2. Install Expo
   ------------
   Using your mobile/tablet device, visit either the Google or Apple stores.  Look for
   an app called Expo.  It's logo is a blue circle with a white ^ (caret) symbol (see
   the student manual for a screenshot of the logo).



3. Start the Server, Sync with Expo
   --------------------------------
   Change (cd) to the ch09_native/project1 directory.  Before starting your server, you may wish
   to rename App2.js to App.js (it's okay to overwrite App.js, the original is App1.js).

   Start the server by issuing the command: yarn start.

   After the server starts, a QR code will appear on terminal output.  With Expo started, scan
   the QR code (Expo will automatically see it).  Now your device can "see" changes made by you
   on the development server.



4. Test out the App
   ----------------
   Test out the application by performing a movie search and viewing the results on your mobile
   device.

   Note: the Movie app uses a themoviedb API key specifically registered for this course.  Please
   only use it when writing/modifying/testing code for this course.  Don't use it for personal use.

   You can now make changes to App.js, movie.js, or moviecontainer.js and they will be reflected onto
   your mobile device (please give it a few seconds before it updates the remote device).

   Feel free to change or tweak things as you desire.  Sometimes changing a JS-CSS property
   can help you see the changes to the remote device running Expo.

   That's it!  Enjoy!
