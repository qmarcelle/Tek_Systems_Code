Running this React Native app can be done two ways:

1. Run the package.json with an npm install command which will rebuild the
   node_modules folder (note: it is fairly large--around 250Mb).  Then proceed
   with the npm start or yarn start commands from the project directory.  Expo
   will need to be running on your mobile device and it can connect to your
   server through your network.

2. Run the create-react-native-app tool that you install using npm or yarn.
   It will create a new project.  Then replace the App.js that is created
   in it with either App1.js or App2.js (you will need to overwrite the
   existing App.js).  If you try to run App2 (which is the Movie example),
   you will also need to copy the movie directory into the root of the new
   project.
